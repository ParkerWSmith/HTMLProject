            <h1>The Host</h1>
            <p><img src="_images/TheHost.jpg" alt="The Host poster" width="300" height="400"></p>
            <p>The Host is a Korean horror film that came out in 2006 from the director Joon-ho Bong. What I really like about this film is that it shows the lengths a father will go for his daughter and that messege gets across even though there is a language barrier. Another thing I like about this movie is that it was my introduction into non-American made films. I had never seen a movie that wasn’t in English, if you had told me that I was going to watch one and it would be my favorite horror movie I would have said you were crazy. After that I realized that it doesn’t matter what language the medium is in, if it’s an engaging story then you are sucked in and forget there are even subtitles to read.</p>
            <h2>The Plot</h2>
            <p>The official IMDB plot is as follows. A monster emerges from Seoul's Han River and focuses its attention on attacking people. One victim's loving family does what it can to rescue her from its clutches.</p>
            <p>But that barely scrapes the surface of what this movie is about. It’s about Gang-Doo, played by the actor Kang-ho Song, who hasn’t surmounted to anything in his life and feels bad about not being able to support his daughter, played by actor Doona Bae, as well as he should be, with her coming off as the responsible one. But with the arrival of the monster who took his daughter, he has to finally grow up and become the man he was meant to be to save his daughter.</p>
            <h2>The CGI</h2>
            <p>Usually horror movie cinematics don’t age well and after a decade can be looked back at and laughed that it was ever scary. But not with The Host. The Host uses good cinematography to not show the monster fully until the very end and the larger parts that are shown are practical effects layerd with CGI to give it a more real effect. then lighting effects are used brilliantly to give the CGI a real effect that works to this day.</p>
            <h2>The Monster</h2>
            <p>A monster in a horror movie is undeniably the most important part and that's no different with this movie. The Monster, a horrendously mutated fish, was designed by Korean artists Chin Wei Chen (who did the preliminary concept work) and Jang Hee-chul (who refined the conceptual design, and created the textures of the creature) — in strict collaboration with the director. As part of the film’s environmental and political commentary, Joon-ho was first inspired by a real-life occurrence of a mutant fish with a curved spine, found nowhere else than the Han River. “The Monster’s appearance is not based on a pre-existing model,” the director told Korean Film, “The starting idea was taken again from a true story. I read in the newspapers about a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the Han River. The Monster design came mainly from this strange discovery.” If you'd like to read more about this monster and how it was made you can go <a href="https://monsterlegacy.net/2016/07/28/gwoemul-the-host-bong-joon-ho-monster-creature/"><b>Here</b></a> to learn more</p>
